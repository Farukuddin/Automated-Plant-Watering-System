# Automated-Plant-Watering-System
With the advancement of automation technology, life is getting simpler and easier in all aspects. In todayâ€™s world Automatic systems are being preferred over manual system. Automatic system is a growing system of everyday object from industrial machine to consumer goods that can complete tasks while you are busy with other activities.

Today, the farmers are suffering from the lack of rains and scarcity of water. The main objective of this project is to provide an automatic irrigation system thereby saving time, money & power of the farmer. The traditional farmland irrigation techniques require manual intervention. With the automated technology of irrigation the human intervention can be minimized.
              Whenever there is a change in temperature and humidity of the surroundings these sensors senses the change in temperature and humidity and gives an interrupt signal to the micro-controller.
